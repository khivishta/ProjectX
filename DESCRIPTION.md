Using the keys W A S D, navigate your character around a variation of three 2-D 
mazes. While trying to find the end of the maze, you must collect masks that are 
littered around the maze. Simply navigate your character over the masks to pick up 
the mask, if you have successfully done this you will hear an audible cue!

Each mask will grant you 10 points. Be sure to pick up as many masks as possible, 
this will ensure that you have at least 80 points before you reach the end otherwise 
you will have failed the game! The end of the maze is located at the bottom 
right-hand corner of the maze, a blue box in which the character must move into
to finish the game. 

The maze must be completed within a time limit, at the start point you are given
15 seconds.With each new mask collected an additional four seconds is added to the
time limit.This will give you ample time to both plan your route out of the maze
whilst collecting at least 8 masks.Be sure to avoid the walls as they are rigged
to reduce the amount of time you have! Once you have collided into the wall it is 
your responsibility to get your character out,the longer the character is on the
wall the farther it will travel into the wall!Collisions with the wall will also 
reduce the amount of time you have left to complete the game, so make sure to get 
out of the wall the same you got in.
